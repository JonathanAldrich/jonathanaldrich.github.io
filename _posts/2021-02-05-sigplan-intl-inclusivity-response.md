On International Inclusion at Virtual Conferences: A Response to SIGPLAN
========================================================================

On December 22, 2021, the three of us and 215 cosigners (as of this writing) sent an
[open letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16pfd5ljGu5urynHmYaW53DM2-rzryRJ0bisgc16IwKo/edit)
to the organizers of POPL 2021 and SIGPLAN leadership, asking them to make POPL
accessible to the entire world and to commit to doing the same in future virtual
SIGPLAN conferences.  SIGPLAN and POPL recently responded to our letter in a
[blog post](https://blog.sigplan.org/popl21-open-letter-repsonse/).

As organizers of the original petition we think it is important that we respond
to the SIGPLAN blog post.

We want to start by saying that we believe that everyone involved was well 
intentioned and doing their very best under very difficult circumstances.
We also want to say that we are very pleased that in response to the open
letter, SIGPLAN has publicly committed to “offer people from all time zones
approximately equal opportunity to engage” in future virtual conferences.

The reason we’re writing is simple.  The POPL’21 organizers made the
synchronous component of the conference inaccessible to a significant
fraction of the global community.   We care about this and SIGPLAN’s
response to it because each sets an important precedent.

The SIGPLAN response is threefold, arguing that: the committee
are well-intentioned, the committee have made other positive innovations,
and that the synchronous schedule is insignificant.   The response doesn't acknowledge
that an inherently exclusive synchronous program is at odds with SIGPLAN’s
stated goals of inclusivity.

We have expressed empathy with the organizers and have not suggested that they
had anything but the best of intentions.   We previously called out their
innovative exploration of asynchronous scheduling as a positive step.
However, neither are germane to the discussion, so it is puzzling to see so much
of the response above dedicated to these points.   Raising them distracts from
the substantive concern (inclusion), makes the discussion unnecessarily
personal, and unfortunately carries an inference that the community’s raising
of the concrete concerns was an attack on the committee’s motives or a
suggestion that their asynchronous experiment was a problem.   Neither is the
case.

The argument that POPL’21’s synchronous schedule is ‘small’ and thus somehow
insignificant is problematic at multiple levels.   In our letter, we described
the synchronous element as ‘core’, which speaks to its significance, not its
size.   It is disingenuous to suggest that the POPL’21 synchronous program is
insignificant.   If it were, then of course it could have been removed from the
program, all the more so given the committee’s desire to explore asynchronous
interactions and the substantial organizational effort in running it.   It could
also have been rescheduled to a different time zone as a demonstration of how
insignificant it was.   Of course neither were tenable precisely because the
synchronous schedule is absolutely core to POPL.   As it transpired, the
distress generated by the failure of the software platform during the first day
of the POPL’21 synchronous program emphatically makes this point — the
synchronous program was a central, critical, element of POPL’21, and it was, by
design, exclusive.   This is profoundly problematic.

The suggestion in the letter above that the community should ‘judge for
themselves’ how well an exclusive event works is equality problematic as it
promulgates and deepens a survivorship bias already deeply entrenched in SIGPLAN
engagement and attendance.

There is no shame in making a mistake, particularly when organizing an
international event in the context of a pandemic.  The problem we’re facing
appears to be a deep unwillingness to acknowledge that making the heart of the
POPL’21 program exclusive was an error.   This unwillingness to own the problem
and learn from it is at odds with SIGPLAN’s stated intention to ‘educate
ourselves’ with respect to inclusion and to make a ‘better place’.   

This is disheartening, to say the least.
