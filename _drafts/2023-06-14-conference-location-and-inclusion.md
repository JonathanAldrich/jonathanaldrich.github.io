Conference Location and Inclusion
=================================

This week [PLDI 2023](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/), one of the top conferences in Programming Languages, is being held in Orlando, Florida.  A student in my research community mentioned to me that she had considered attending the conference.  But, she is transgender, and Florida has passed [laws](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/25/floridas-trans-people-parents-of-trans-kids-see-options-steadily-banned/70132161007/) that make traveling to Florida unsafe for trans people.

In Florida, trans people cannot use bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity in any state or local government building, college, or school--and given the risk they would face in entering a bathroom that doesn't correspond to their gender identity, in practice this means they have no options at all in those buildings.  Laws allowing doctors to deny care to trans people or regulating gender-affirming care may make trans people worry about what would happen to them in a medical emergency situation, for example, whether they would have access to their  medications, from which a withdrawal could have [immediate and severe consequences](https://enbynyc.com/blogs/news/side-effects-of-stopping-hrt-suddenly).  Beyond bills with a direct effect on conference attendees, laws that enforce "Don't Say Gay" in schools, restrict sports participation, or ban books create a poisonous environment for trans people in states like Florida.

I have generally pushed back on proposals to restrict the location of conferences based on political issues.  One challenge is that almost any location has potential issues, whether it be related to politics, accessibility, or CO2 emissions.  If we say that conferences can only be so that "typical attendees" don't have to travel far, for example, we will never locate our top international conferences outside North America or Europe, which is very exclusionary to the rest of the world.

But I believe this issue is different--when we locate a conference in Florida, we are choosing a location where a part of our community is unwelcome and unsafe.  It's more than "making a statement" - people are being deliberately excluded from participation in our conferences when we locate them there.  Furthermore, there are many alternatives: even just within the United States, there are many states that are, in contrast to Florida, explicitly taking action to protect the rights of trans people (a recent example came when the Governor declared Maryland a "Trans Sanctuary State").

My intent is not to criticize the organizers of PLDI--binding contracts with hotels are signed many months (and often years) in advance of a conference, and changing the venue in response to laws passed within the last two months would be extraordinarily difficult and expensive, not to mention distruptive to other people's plans to attend.  Yet, the effect on trans people of locating this and other conferences in anti-trans states is, in the longer run, unacceptable.

I believe that going forward, the ACM, IEEE, and other organizations in Computer Science should not plan conferences in events with laws that threaten the safety of the trans members of our community (or other groups of attendees).  I call on leaders at SIGPLAN, the ACM, and the IEEE Computer Society to come together to discuss this issue and to create policies to ensure that all members of our community are safe and welcomed at our future events.
